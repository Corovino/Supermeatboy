#To do:
-walljumping

-fix collision. Problem with checking the top for collisions. What does the 50 mean?

-Make a gui level editor to create our levels. Drag and drop different types of platforms. Write out the platform objects to an xml file, then read the xml file in each level.

-implement tiled and tilemaps.
	
-different types of platforms(subclasses).
	Type:

	-the platforms pairs that switch, one becoming invisible, the other becoming visible

	-platforms that disappear after they are touched

	-moving platforms

	-spikes

	-??? Add any ideas in this readme.
-AI

-make a running animation for meatboy. So when he has only an x velocity, switch to the running .png file. If he has an x and a y velocity, give him a jumping .png file. Otherwise, use regular.
